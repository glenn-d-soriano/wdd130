      <p>Hello! My name is Glenn Danniel Mendoza Soriano and I am from Winnipeg MB, Canada. I am married to my wife Yen Soriano and have two wonderful boys named Aiath (10) and Aizen (3). I am currently serving as the Stake President of the Winnipeg MB East Stake, Canada. I work full-time for BELL as a Senior Business Collection Specialist. I love playing table tennis with my son Aiath and love travelling with my family once a year. My family loves the Lord and we show it through serving other people. I am excited and looking forward to get a degree through the inspired BYU pathway connect program. </p>
